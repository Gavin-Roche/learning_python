Darts 501 Scoring Game

- Players start with a score of 501.
- Each turn consists of 3 throws, and the total score for the turn is subtracted from 501.
- The goal is to reach exactly 0.
- If a playerâ€™s score goes below 0, the turn is "not counted" (the score is restored).
- The game continues until the player wins by reaching exactly 0.
