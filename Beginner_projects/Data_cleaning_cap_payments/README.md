# Cap Payment Data Cleaner
This script is designed to clean and structure raw CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) payment data from a CSV file containing unformatted text entries. The original data, stored in [Uncleaned_2009_cap_data.csv](Uncleaned_2009_cap_data.csv), contains recipient names, addresses, and payment amounts all within a single unstructured string. The script reads each row, uses basic string operations to isolate the recipientâ€™s name, their address, and the payment amount (removing formatting like commas and currency symbols), and then writes this cleaned information to a new file called 2009_farmers_cap_payments.csv.
