"""
This script processes raw CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) payment data from an uncleaned CSV file, 
extracting names, addresses, and payment amounts. The cleaned data is then written to a new CSV file 
with structured formatting.

Steps:
1. Reads raw data from "Uncleaned_2009_cap_data.csv".
2. Extracts name, address, and payment amount using string operations.
3. Writes the cleaned data to "2009_farmers_cap_payments.csv".
