# Fundamental Concept Implementations
This folder contains slightly larger test programs that explore basic programming concepts. While still simple, they offer more functionality than the smallest exercises in [Basic_concepts_projects](../Basic_concepts_projects/) and [Basic_projects](../Basic_projects/). Some of these programs were developed in a classroom setting and others independently for their utility. For example, [Memo_file_cleaner.py](./Memo_file_cleaner/Memo_file_cleaner.py) was written to clean a memorization file I got off the internet to help remember letter pairs for learning to solve the Rubikâ€™s Cube blindfolded.
